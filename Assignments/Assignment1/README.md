# Assignment 1 description

1. For the sake of simplicity, I will represent the marbles as just the total number of
marbles in the bag. just a integer variable named "bag" would cut it.

2. Adding marbles to the bag would be very simple, just add the desired number of marbles
bag with bag = bag + 5, if you wanted to add 5 marbles.

3. Similarly, removing marbles will just be using subtracion.

4. To show that the implementation works correctly, have the program start with
an arbitrary number of marbles in the bag, then print out the number of marbles
currently in the bag. Then add some marbles, print again, and finally subtract
and print.
