Functions

    Definition:
    [return type (eg. int)] [function name] (params [don't forget to include data type before each]) {
        [Function action]
    }
        Intellisense note: putting a comment on the line above a function definition makes the 
            comment appear when hovering over any function calls. Like docstrings in py
        Syntax note: Function definitions must be made BEFORE all function calls
            or the program gets mad (Unless you use a forward declaration, 
            but just don't okay?)

Arrays
    Definition:
    ex:
    int numbers[5] = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15};
        int = accepted data type
        numbers = array name
        5 = array size. Must be a constant, cannot be modified.

For loops
    ex:
    for (int index = 0 [starting value]; index < 5 [continuation condition]; ++index [increment (up 1 in this case)]) {

    }
