Abstract Data Type (ADT):
    Mathematic that describes how data is organized as seen from user
    eg. Stack

Stack:
    ADT Serves collection of elems w/ two main operations (think stack of plates):
    -Push 
        Adds elem to collection
    -Pop
        Remove most recently added elem
    -Peek (Optional but usually implemented):
        Return value of most recently added elem

Queue:
    ADT Similar to Stack. Keeps track of order of all entered elems
    -Enqueue:
        Add elem to "Back" of Queue
    -Dequeue:
        Remeove elem from "front" of queue (first added elem)

spnote:
    int *var[int] creates an array of pointers, not a pointer to an array

    "void" type: usually used to return nothing
        means object's data type is unknown

    Segmentaion fault:
        Segment: space object takes up in memory (amount of memory allocated
        to object)
        Fault occurs when trying to access something outside segment
