    Tree data structure
    Items May have left child and right child

Binary search Tree  
    Left childs are all less than parents, right childs are greater
    Inserting new values
        Value goes down Tree by following which values it is greater than or less
        than until it reaches a nullptr
        
    AVL Tree    
        Binary search that automatically sorts
        Node has int representing total # children: +1 for right child, -1 for left
        If total children reaches 2  or -2, rotation
